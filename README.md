# RO-Crate Playground

Status: the playground is in active development and deployed as a proof of concept in https://ro-crate.ldaca.edu.au ,
please let report bugs using Github issues in this repository.

The ro-crate playground allows developers and users alike to write, run, and experiment with ro-crate directly in the
browser. This will serve quick prototyping, learning, and sharing ro-crate with others.

It is a place to learn basic use of RO-crate - zero risk play environment for techs and non-techs alike.

## Tools

and ideas.
